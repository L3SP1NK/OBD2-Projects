## Car ECU emulation on x86 linux?
## USB2CAN?

## tty ACMEX / USBX
/dev/ttyACME0	→	driver embeded inside the controller	( serial-to-USB is performed inside the controller. )
/dev/ttyUSB0	→	additional driver need to be installed	( serial-to-USB is performed on the computer. )


[ MONITOR ]

• 206+ VAN or CAN? (PSA VAN-to-CAN [https://github.com/morcibacsi/PSAVanCanBridge])
• python3 obd [https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/] monitor(){watch $example}

[ SNIF & REPLAY ]

## Connect to device using screen:
• screen <device> <baud rate> (e.g. screen /dev/ttyACME0 38400,cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl)

## CAN Code:
( Remember to type ATZ ('echo "ATZ \r" > /dev/ttyACME0' for newline?) and press [enter] before inputing anything )

### Once talking to the car using CAN, you can send OBD code to get the current value of the desired params.
### The response format is the following:
### 41 01 cX XX
### where "41 01 c" is the parameters and "X XX" is the current value.

• 410c → Engine RPM
• 410d → Vehicle Speed (Km/H)

## ESP32/Arduino
• Vehicle Area Network (VAN) bus packet reader/writer for ESP8266 and ESP32 [https://github.com/0xCAFEDECAF/VanBus]
• Live data from your PSA vehicle (Peugeot, Citroën) on your smartphone or tablet, directly from the VAN bus [https://github.com/0xCAFEDECAF/VanLiveConnect]
